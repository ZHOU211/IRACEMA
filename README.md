## IsogeometRic Analysis ComputEr MATLAB Application

This is a package of Octave/MATLAB routines used for Isogeometric Analysis, with a focus in Vibration and Acoustics.

The package is organized in three sections:

NURBS - A compilation of algorithms, mostly from Pigl and Tiller's "The NURBS Book", that are used to describe NURBS geometries.

IGA - Algorithms for assembly and shape routines based on the book "Isogeometric Analysis: Toward Integration of CAD and FEA" by J. Cottrell, T. Hughes and Y. Bazilevs

Examples - A folder of 1D, 2D and 3D example geometries.

For more details on how to use each package, specially the Geometry class, please consult the Wiki.

This package is maintained by Guilherme H. da Silva (dshguilherme@gmail.com) and André Demétrio Magalhães (demagalha@hotmail.com), from Laboratório de Vibrações e Acústica (LVA), Department of Mechanical Engineering of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC).
